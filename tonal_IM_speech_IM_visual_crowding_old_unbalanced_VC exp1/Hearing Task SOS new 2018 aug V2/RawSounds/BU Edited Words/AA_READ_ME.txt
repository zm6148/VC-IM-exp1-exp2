The edited recordings of the words spoken by the 
18 talkers are contained in 18 separate directories named 
by talker number. 

Talkers [1:8 17] are males; talkers [9:16 18] are females. 

Each recording filename includes the name of the list, the 
talker number, and the word number. For the BUG and ODB lists, 
which have specified positions for the words, each word is 
denoted by two numbers -- the row (i.e., 'sentence') number 
and the column (i.e., word position) number. The CRM words also 
have specified positions but were numbered serially, with the 
position (e.g., color, number, etc) included in the filename.

The files AUX_words.mat, etc, identify the word numbers for
the five lists. 

The TVM word lists were different for each talker. 
Each talker spoke 50 TVM words starting with the word number 
given in TVM_Start.mat.

Recordings were edited to remove transients, but were not 
level-normalized in any way.
